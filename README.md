# 📰 Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

A simple yet effective machine learning application that detects whether a news article is **fake** or **real** based on its content. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Combines real and fake news datasets
- Cleans and vectorizes text using TF-IDF
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier
- Saves trained model and vectorizer using `joblib`
- Provides a Streamlit web interface to classify news articles in real-time

## 🧠 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- Two CSV files:
  - `Fake.csv`: Contains fake news articles
  - `True.csv`: Contains real news articles
